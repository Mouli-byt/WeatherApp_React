Here i built weatherApp that tells you whether and humidity and other details of a particular city which you search.
Here i bulid three components - <br>
 +WeatherApp component used to passes state variable(whether info in object form) to infobox and state variable updation function to search component. <br>
 +info component simply displays information and an image based on humidity <br>
 +search compent fetches new weather data through an api from openweathermap Api and update info in state variable.
